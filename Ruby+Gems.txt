Ruby+Gems.txt - explains the current Ruby and Rubygems setup needed for this toy docker.

Ruby on this host id installed by 'ruby-install' in /opt/rubies
Use chruby 2.2.2 to select it before running rake.

Logging: The Rakefile make use the log() method. This is suplied by the 'logging' gem:
  sudo gem install logging

The rake module can be found in ./lib/tasks/log.rake

Versions of Ruby
This toy Docker example can be run with any version of Ruby from 1.9+ Currently, pdfocr uses 1.9.3 from apt-get. The host Ruby is 2.2. but apt-get 1.9.3 would work as well
== ruby-install and chruby
On Digital Ocean and Vagrant VMs, I am using 'install-ruby --system ruby 2.2.2' which installs ruby in /opt/rubies
To get to run for you: run 'chruby 2.2.2' or put that in ~/.bashrc
